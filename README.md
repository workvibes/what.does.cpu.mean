# What Does CPU mean?

CPU is short for Central Processing Unit. It is also known as a processor or microporcessor.

It's one of the most important pieces of hardware in any digital computing system – if not the most important.

Inside a CPU there are thousands of microscopic transistors, which are tiny switches that control the flow of electricity through the integrated circuits.

You'll find the CPU located on a computer's motherboard.

A computer's motherboard is the main circuit board inside a computer. Its job is to connect all hardware components together.

Often referred to as the brain and heart of all digital systems, a CPU is responsible for doing all the work. It performs every single action a computer does and executes programs.




## What does a CPU do?
In a nutshell, a CPU is responsible for handling the processing of logical and mathematical operations and executing instructions that it is given.

It can execute millions of instructions per second – but can carry out only one instruction at a time.

It first receives some type of input, typically from an input device (such as a monitor display screen, a keyboard, a mouse, or a microphone) or from an application/system software program (like your web browser or operating system).


## The main parts of a CPU
Now you know the basic tasks a CPU performs for every operation happening on a computer, what are the parts of the CPU that help get that work done?

**Below are some of the important components within it:**

* **CU (short for Control Unit).** It regulates the flow of input and output. It's the part that fetches and retrieves the instructions from main memory and later decodes them.

* **ALU (short for Artithmetic Logic Unit).** The part where all the processing happens. Here is where all mathematic calculations take place, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as all the logical operations for decision making, such as comparing data.

* **Registers.** An extremely fast memory location. The data and instructions that are currenlty being processed during the fetch-execute cycle are stored there, for quick access by the processor.
